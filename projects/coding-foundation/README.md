Since this was was my first time coding in a while, this assignment was a little challenging to get the hang of initially. However, after some relearning, I was able to get most elements of the website done.

One challenge I encountered was making my boxes flex wrap. Since I drew my boxes in javascript and not HTML, I did not know how to get the elements to draw in rows without using CSS. When I tried to style the boxes in JS, I encountered the same problem. So, if you input a large number into the text box, the boxes will draw only filling the first row.

To avert the problem, I decided to create fun patterns by playing with for loops.
